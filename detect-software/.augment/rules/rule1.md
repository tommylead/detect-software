**CRITICAL**: Always understand your project's specific structure:

1. **Repository Strategy**: [CUSTOMIZE: Single repo / Multi-repo / Monorepo / Submodules]
   - **Primary Repository**: [CUSTOMIZE: Main repo purpose and location]
   - **Secondary Repositories**: [CUSTOMIZE: If applicable - planning, source, etc.]
   - **Submodules**: [CUSTOMIZE: List any Git submodules and their purposes]

2. **Directory Organization**: [CUSTOMIZE: Based on actual project structure]
   - **Planning Directory**: [CUSTOMIZE: Where plans and docs are stored]

### **Rule 2: Implementation Location Verification**
**BEFORE ANY WORK**:
```bash
# ALWAYS verify location and structure first
pwd
ls -la
# [CUSTOMIZE: Add project-specific verification commands]
```

**CORRECT Paths** [CUSTOMIZE for your project]:
- ‚úÖ `[PROJECT_ROOT]/[SOURCE_DIR]/` - Implementation location
- ‚úÖ `[PROJECT_ROOT]/[PLANNING_DIR]/` - Planning and documentation
- ‚ùå `[WRONG_LOCATIONS]/` - Common mistake locations
- ‚ùå Any work in wrong repository/directory

## üìã **PLANNING WORKFLOW RULES**

### **Rule 3: Pre-Planning Analysis**
**MANDATORY steps before any planning**:
